> TIP: Have some [Black Beans](https://github.com/gabrie30/recipes/blob/main/cookbook/black-beans.md)
 ready before starting.

## Ingredients

- 1 block of fresh tofu, freeze and thaw before cooking for a spongier tofu that soaks up the sauce
- 1 lb. of lean ground beef
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2-3 green onions, chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 5 cups cooked black beans (optional)

### For the sauce:
- 2 Tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 heaping Tbsp. garlic black bean sauce
- 2 Tbsp. chili sauce
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 2 Tbsp. corn starch
- 2 1/4 cups chicken stock
- Salt & pepper, to taste

## Preparation

1. Saut√© the ground beef with all the ingredients (except for the tofu, chicken stock, and green onions).
2. Once the mixture is cooked, add in the chicken stock and let it simmer for 5-10 mins.
3. Stop to taste test and adjust the level of spiciness, salt, or sugar (if needed).
4. Thicken the sauce with cornstarch & work quickly to stir.
5. Add black beans and work into the sauce (optional)
5. Gently add in the tofu cubes and finally the green onions for garnish.


## Notes

- Instead of the garlic black bean sauce, try the chili bean sauce (toban djan) instead
