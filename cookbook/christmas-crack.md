### Ingredients
- 45 saltine crackers
- 1 cup (2 sticks / 227 g) unsalted butter
- 1 cup (200 g) light brown sugar, packed
- 1½ cups (252 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Arrange the crackers (45), salted side down, in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. Set aside.
3. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the butter (1 cup) and brown sugar (1 cup). Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
4. Boil for 3-5 minutes, or until the toffee reaches 270°F – 290°F, darkens in color, and thickens slightly.
5. Remove from heat and carefully pour the toffee mixture evenly over the crackers.
6. Bake for 3-5 minutes, or until the mixture begins to bubble.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips (1½ cups) on top.
8. Let the chocolate chips sit for about one minute, then spread the melted chocolate over the crackers using an offset spatula.
9. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator for about an hour, or to the freezer for 30 minutes, until set.
10. Once set, break the Christmas Crack into small, uneven pieces by hand.

### Does it freeze

Yes, you can freeze Christmas Crack! In fact, freezing this treat is a great way to get a head start on your holiday treats. When storing the pieces in a freezer-safe container, separate the layers with parchment or wax paper to keep them all from sticking together. It will last about a month or two in the freezer. When ready to enjoy, remove as many pieces as you are craving and let them sit at room temperature for a few minutes to slightly soften.
