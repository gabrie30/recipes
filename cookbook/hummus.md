# Hummus Recipe

## Tips

- This does not keep for long, about a week in the fridge. So if you were to double this you could freeze half.
- Tahini brands I prefer are: Cedar’s, Seed + Mill, and Soom

- 2/3 cup smooth tahini
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste
- 5 garlic cloves, plus more to taste
- 3 teaspoon sea salt
- water, or as needed to blend
- Paprika, red pepper flakes, and/or fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. If you’re using canned chickpeas, boil them in water with 2 tbsp baking soda for a few minutes to help them soften.
