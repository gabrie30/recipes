# Masala Tea

## Ingredients

1 inch piece of ginger
2 inch piece of cinnamon stick
3 peppercorns
4 cloves
4 cardamom pods
1 tbsp black Indian tea
2 cup milk
2 cups water
3 tbsp sugar
5 bags of black tea (used breakfast tea, but Assam is recommended)

## Instructions

Dry roast the ginger under a broiler for 1 minute on each side. Put the spices and ginger in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder and roughly crush them. Put the spices, tea, in a saucepan with 2 cups water, 1tbsp sugar and bring to a boil.

Leave for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat and add 5 bags of black tea. Leave for 10 minutes, then add the milk and remaining sugar, to taste.

Strain off the grounds, then pour the tea.

## Notes

- I used 4 to 1 milk to water ratio and it was too watery.
- I used 4 bags of tea, but it was a little weak.
- I didnt add sugar early I only added it to my cup of tea.
- Condensed milk would probably be good if I had some.
