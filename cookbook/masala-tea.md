# Masala Tea

## Ingredients

1 inch piece of ginger or 2 tsp ground ginger
2 inch piece of cinnamon stick or 1/2 tsp ground
3 peppercorns
5 cloves
5 cardamom pods
1 cup milk
3.5 cups water (to account for evaporation 3:1 water/milk)
2 tbsp brown sugar
4 bags of black tea (Assam is recommended then Darjeeling, then if push comes to shove Breakfast tea or Lipton Black)
1 star anise or 1/4 tsp ground (optional)

## Instructions

Dry roast the ginger under a broiler for 1 minute on each side. Put the spices and ginger in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder and roughly crush them. Put the spices, tea, in a saucepan with 2 cups water, 1tbsp sugar and bring to a boil.

Leave for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat and add tea to steep. Leave for 10 minutes, then add the milk and sugar.

Strain off the grounds, then pour the tea.

## Notes

- Condensed milk would probably be good if I had some.
- Some say let the milk boil back up while stiring so it does not burn and then pour from one pot to another a few times to create a foam texture on top.
