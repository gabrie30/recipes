Recipe from https://littlespicejar.com/lebanese-garlic-sauce-toum/

The key here is to drain the oil in very slowly. The cup method in the youtube video works great. If you dont do this it will just be watery.


## Ingredients

- 1 cup garlic cloves (slice down the center and remove green germ)
- 2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (two whole lemons squeezed)
- 3 cups colorless oil (such as sunflower)


## Instructions

1. GARLIC: Pulse the garlic and salt together in the food processor until very finely minced. Scrape down the sides and up the bowl. Run the food processor while adding 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

1. EMULSION: Stop the food processor and scrape down the bowl one last time. Then run the food processor while you add .5 cup of oil, in a very slow consistent stream. Use the cup trick in the video to make sure the stream is consistent. Followed by 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Until you have everything gone.

1. REFRIGERATE: Transfer the garlic sauce to a bowl or glass mason jar, cover with paper towel on the spread. The garlic sauce will lose its garlicky flavor the longer it sits so I usually try to use it within 1 month. The sauce can be consumed immediately or after refrigeration.
