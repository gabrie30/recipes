### Instructions

1. Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large heavy-based skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add 5-6 tbsp curry paste and Extras (if using jar paste) and cook for about 2 minutes until it “dries out”.
3. Add 1 cup chicken broth and stir to dissolve paste. Simmer rapidly for 3 minutes or until liquid reduces by half.
4. Add 400 ml coconut milk, 6 lime leaves, 1 tbsp sugar, and 2 tsp fish sauce. Stir, then add 350g chicken.
5. Spread chicken out, bring to simmer, then turn heat down to medium. Simmer for about 8-10 minutes until sauce reduces and chicken is cooked.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce or sugar if needed.
7. Add 150g pumpkin and 120g beans, stir. Cook for 3 minutes until pumpkin is just cooked through and sauce is thickened.
8. Remove from heat. Stir through 12 Thai basil leaves.
9. Squeeze juice of 1-2 limes to taste
10. Serve over jasmine rice, garnished with fresh red chili slices and fresh coriander/cilantro leaves, if desired.

**Recipe Notes:**
1. Curry paste – if using store bought, try to get Maesri brand if you can, it’s the best (small can, very cheap). Sold at major grocery stores (Woolies, Coles) or Asian stores. Otherwise, use your favourite. Use 5 tbsp if you are unsure about spiciness, or 6 tbsp (or the whole can!) if you are sure you can handle it! Note: curry paste in jars has a more concentrated flavour than fresh homemade paste so you need less. The video shows homemade paste.
2. Extras – these are to freshen up store bought curry paste. Not required if using homemade.
3. Lemongrass paste – convenience tubes of cold pressed lemongrass paste, the next best thing to peeling / finely chopping fresh lemongrass! Can sub with 2 tsp finely minced fresh lemongrass.
4. Kaffir Lime Leaves are the leaves of a kaffir lime tree. It’s used to add earthy citrus flavours into Asian food. Sold at large grocery stores and Asian stores. Dried is an ok substitute (same amount), but I really urge you to try to find fresh if you can because it adds that “something-something” that really makes this “restaurant quality”.
5. Chicken – Thigh is best for this recipe because it’s nice and juicy. But breast and tenderloin is fine too.
6. Thai Basil looks like normal basil but has pointier leaves and a purplish tinge. It tastes like basil + aniseed. Not the end of the world if you can’t find it – ordinary basil will be an adequate substitute but only use a small handful.
7. General recipe notes:
   - Spiciness: Thai Red Curry is not supposed to be crazy spicy but it has a nice tingle to it.
   - Sauce thickness varies drastically between restaurants – at some it is almost watery, at others it is really thick and seems to be made with coconut cream. I like mine in between – a sauce that is pourable but with a gravy-like consistency. I am not a fan of very sweet Red Curry, but if you are, just add more sugar.
   - Consistency: Thai red curry sauce doesn’t look completely smooth, it looks a bit split because of the oil and that’s the way it is supposed to be.
   - Stuff in it: There are no hard and fast rules about what goes into a Thai Red Curry. You’ll find Thai eggplant in curries at very authentic Thai restaurants but to be honest, I am not a huge fan of them – they are like tiny eggplants and kind of hard (also not easy to find in shops). I’d say that the two most common vegetables I’ve noticed are pumpkin and green beans or snake beans. While pumpkin may not sound “Thai”, don’t dismiss it, it is spectacular in red curry for both the texture, the sweetness and also because it soaks up the sauce.
