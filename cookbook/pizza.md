### Tips

1. Make this double size. You can freeze the pizza dough and it will last 4 months. Making the dough is the most time consuming/messy part of this. Once you have the dough prepared making a pizza is quick and easy. Wrap dough in plastic wrap then freezer bag. When you want to use one put it in the fridge the night before, then out of the fridge about 4 hours before you want to make it. The dough should be visibly risen if yeast is active.

1. Use a food processor to mix the wet/dry ingredients, it makes quick work of this step.

## Dough

### Recipe

| Ingredient | Percentage | Weight | Volume |
|------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Bread Flour | 100% | 500g | 4 cup |
| Water | 60% | 300g | 1.27 cup |
| Salt | 2% | 10g | 2 tsp |
| Sugar | 3% | 15g | 3 tsp |
| Oil | 2% | 10g | 2.5 tsp |
| Yeast | 1% | 5g | 1.5 tsp |

> If you do not have bread flour unbleached will work too
> 3 dough balls at appx 280g will be appropriate for 12" pizzas.

[http://brdclc.com/](http://brdclc.com/) is a helpful tool if you want to scale up/down a recipe or modify it. Though dough tends to be a bit more consistent at larger matches.

- Salt can be adjusted (i.e. -1% or +1%) to taste.
- Sugar depends on oven; high temp ovens (600*F+) may not need any but (500-550*) home ovens can benefit from the extra browning.
- Yeast can be upped to 2% for same-day dough. (If you're using Active Dry Yeast instead of Instant, use 25% more yeast, and activate it in a separate dish with a tiny amount of warm water for a few mins before using)
- I think 58-62% hydration is the goldilocks zone for beginner friendliness. Dry doughs tend to be flaky, brittle, harder to stretch, they tear. Wet doughs are very sticky, causing people to accidentally overstretch them when they get stuck to a surface, or sometimes people underknead them because they want to minimize the time handling that dough.
- Oil helps dough be supple, easy to stretch and retain moisture. But too much oil can block the flour and water from binding if it's not incorporated evenly, which could be a pain point for beginners.

### Mixing

Before mixing, I recommend using a thermometer on the water. 65-70*F is a decent starting point. The colder the dough is, the longer it needs to warm ferment before refrigerating; the warmer it is, the quicker it needs to be refrigerated. But I'd lean toward the warm side, since, for a beginner, there's a risk of the yeast never activating if the dough isn't warm enough before refrigerating.

Mixing order is subjective, but I'd recommend:
1. Add water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl.
2. Add flour. Then add salt on top of flour.
3. Mix half-way.
4. Very slowly add in oil. (i.e. take 30+ seconds to add in all the oil, maybe more for larger batches)
5. Finish mixing.

### Preparation

The goal is to refrigerate the dough as soon as it STARTS fermenting. How fast it ferments depends on your yeast %, water temperature, and room temperature.

But a good starting point after the dough is finished mixing:
1. Leave it in the bowl for 30-60 mins (cover with light coating of oil and a damp towel). Larger batches may proof more quickly since there's less surface area and more heat trapped in the center.
2. Portion it into balls. Coat tray with oil (or spray oil). Coat balls with oil. Wrap.
3. Let the portioned balls sit at room temp for 1-2 hours, then store.

## Sauce

> Whatever option you choose make sure you blot the tomatoes with a paper tower to soak up as much water as you can. Otherwise your pizza will be watery.

#### Homemade Option

- Get 3 ripe tomatoes and skin them by first scoring an x on the bottom 1 inch long then placing them in boiling water, then an icebath to cool. Cut take out all seeds and gooey bits. Then mash together with your hands, add some salt and pepper.

#### Premade Option

- Highest quality canned tomatoes you can find or pre bought pizza sauce

## Directions

1. Put dough ball in a floured and oiled cast iron pan and spread evenly
1. Use fork to make holes in bottom to release any air pockets
1. Take can of tomatoes or pre bought pizza sauce and spread evenly, remove any additional water from tomatoes with paper tower, then add salt on top to taste
1. Add toppings
1. Preheat oven and bake at 500 degrees for 15-20 min, do not open the oven. Makes 3 - 12‚Äù pies
