### Tips

1. Make this double size. You can freeze the pizza dough and it will last 4 months. Making the dough is the most time consuming/messy part of this. Once you have the dough prepared making a pizza is quick and easy. Wrap dough in plastic wrap then freezer bag. When you want to use one put it in the fridge the night before, then out of the fridge about 4 hours before you want to make it. The dough should be visibly risen if yeast is active.
1. Use a food processor to mix the wet/dry ingredients, it makes quick work of this step.

## Dough Ingredients

- 3.5 cups of flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 packet of dry active yeast (I use pizza yeast)
- 1.5 cups lukewarm water (room temp water in microwave for 35 seconds)
- 3 Tbs olive oil

- Highest quality canned tomatoes you can find or pre bought pizza sauce

## Directions

1. In a cup warm up 1.5 cups of water, microwave for 35 seconds, then add in yeast, salt, and sugar then stir
1. Combine dry ingredients, stir in liquid from cup, until dough ball forms (use food processor or mixer instead for better results)
1. Kneed 10 min, coat with oil, cover and let rise in a warm place for 60 min
1. Separate into two equal parts, form into balls, cover with plastic wrap, wait 10 min,
1. Put dough ball in a floured and oiled cast iron pan and spread evenly
