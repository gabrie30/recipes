# Garlicky Chicken and Couscous with Dill Topping

### Ingredients

**For the garlicky chicken and couscous:**
- 4 to 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (1.5 to 2 pounds total)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil (sunflower or grape seed)
- 2 medium shallots, finely sliced
- 1.5 cups pearled (Israeli) couscous or orzo
- 3 cups water
- 15 cloves garlic, lightly crushed and peeled
- 1 chicken bouillon cube, or 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder

**For the dill topping:**
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh dill
- 1/3 cup brined capers, drained, rinsed, and finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
- 3 cloves garlic, finely grated or minced
- 1 teaspoon red chile flakes, plus more to taste
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Pat the chicken thighs (4 to 6) dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper.
2. In a 12-inch ovenproof skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the chicken skin-side down and cook until golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip and cook until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and shallots (2) to the pan. Cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the couscous (1½ cups) and cook until toasty brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Add water (3 cups), garlic (15 cloves), chicken bouillon (1 cube or 2 teaspoons powder), and a pinch of salt. Arrange the chicken thighs on top, skin-side up. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from heat.
5. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil. Bake until most of the liquid is absorbed, 30 to 35 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, make the dill topping: In a small bowl, mix dill (⅓ cup), capers (⅓ cup), vinegar (3 tablespoons), garlic (3 cloves), chile flakes (1 teaspoon), salt, and pepper.
7. Remove the foil from the chicken and bake for another 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Broil until the chicken skin is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven. Crush the softened garlic cloves on top of the chicken. Dollop the dill topping over the hot chicken couscous and serve immediately.
