### **Instructions (Halved)**
Follow the same steps as the original, but adjust baking time slightly (check at 15-20 minutes for the cake layer before adding topping).

### Instructions  
1. Preheat oven to 390°F (200°C). Line a cake pan (30×40 cm or 12×16 in) with baking paper.  
2. Whisk eggs and granulated sugar (1½ cups) together until pale and fluffy.  
3. Melt butter (3½ tbsp) in a saucepan, then add milk (¾ cup). Set aside to cool slightly.  
4. Mix flour (2 cups), baking powder (3 tsp), and vanilla sugar (1 tsp). Sift into the egg mixture and fold gently until smooth. Stir in the butter-milk mixture.  
5. Pour batter into the pan and bake for 18–20 minutes, until golden brown.  

**Coconut topping:**

6. While the cake bakes, melt butter (1 cup + 2 tbsp) in a saucepan. Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar (1¾ cups), granulated sugar (½ cup), and vanilla (3 tsp).  
7. Add milk (½ cup) and shredded coconut (2½ cups), stirring until combined.  
8. Remove cake from oven and spread topping evenly over it. Return to oven and broil for 6–8 minutes, until topping bubbles fully.
9. Cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.
