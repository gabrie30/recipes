## Curry tip

Generally you are going to want Garam Masalla, it's an Indian spice mix that is used for everything. That, turmeric, coconut milk, onions, and tomatoes.

Cook down some onions, toss in a can of tomatoes (Rotel is good if you like spice, but any can of diced tomatoes will do). Let them cook down with the onions and add some garlic in the last minute or so.

When the garlic starts to brown, add your coconut milk and whatever vegetables you want, about a tablespoon of garam Masala and a pinch of turmeric and let it boil. Continue to taste and add spices until the veggies are cooked. I reccomend browning any meat first but in a pinch you can just let it boil, too.

I make it with potatoes and carrots, but the beauty of curry is that it is super adaptable, you can toss almost anything in.

Edit: oh, oyster sauce from the Asian food aisle. You want about a tablespoon of that for salt and umami flavor. It's my secret ingredient for every thing. Western cooking has been sleeping on it.
