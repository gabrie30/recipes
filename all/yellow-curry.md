## Yellow Curry

- [Adapted from: Easy Chicken Curry](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/easy-chicken-curry-recipe/)

NOTE: this recipe is better when you want to add potato and carrot. It has something lacking to it. Although its good. Also its not very thick, so let it simmer for a long time to cook the potato and thicken up. If you want a receipe with no vegetables. The sliced can of tomatoes receipe would be better suited.
